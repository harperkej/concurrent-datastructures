**`Concurrent data structures.`**

This project contains implementations of different concurrency utilities like locks and different concurrent data structures like **Linked Sets**, **Queues**, **Stacks**... (more data structures are probably coming).

implementations inspired from this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Multiprocessor-Programming-Revised-Reprint/dp/0123973376) and from the content of [this course](https://mcs.unibnf.ch/courses/concurrency-multi-core-programming-and-data-processing/).
